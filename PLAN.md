# FudFarmer POS ??? Implementation Plan

An offline-first **Point of Sale PWA** for retail counters: FudFarmer-**owned** stores, **franchised** stores, and **external subscribers** who pay to use it.

> **The governing rule:** the network is never in the critical path of a sale. Every sale completes locally, always. Syncing is a background concern the cashier never waits on.

---

## 1. Why a separate app

The POS is not a CRM screen. Different users (cashiers, not managers), different rhythm (hundreds of small transactions vs. analysis), different device (a till/tablet, often wall-mounted), and different install target (external subscribers install *this*, and must never see FudFarmer's internal data).

It therefore lives in its own folder ??? `fudfarmer-pos/` ??? as its own Next.js PWA with its own manifest, service worker, port and install identity. It talks to the CRM only through one seam (??5).

```
fudfarmer-pos/
  app/            # kiosk-style routes (no CRM chrome)
  lib/            # db (IndexedDB), sync engine, catalog, cart, money, seeds
  components/     # POS UI primitives (keypad, tiles, receipt)
  public/         # manifest.webmanifest, service worker, icons
  PLAN.md
```

## 2. Architecture

```
?????? POS PWA (installed, works with zero network) ?????????????????????????????????????????????
???  Sell ??? Cart ??? Payment ??? Receipt                            ???
???      ??? writes locally, ALWAYS (never awaits network)         ???
???      ???                                                       ???
???  IndexedDB:  catalog ?? customers ?? sales ?? OUTBOX ?? settings ???
???      ???                                                       ???
???  Sync engine: online-event + interval + manual, FIFO,        ???
???               idempotent by client-generated sale id         ???
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
       ??? when reachable
  SyncBackend (interface)
    ??? prototype  ??? writes into the CRM's local data layer
    ??? production ??? real REST API (same method signatures)
```

**Service worker** precaches the app shell so a cold start with no network still boots the till. **Manifest** makes it installable to the home screen, standalone display, landscape-friendly.

## 3. Data model (local)

| Store | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `settings` | Store profile, device, active shift | One row (`id: 'store'`) |
| `catalog` | Sellable products + prices | Synced down (owned/franchise) or user-owned (subscriber) |
| `customers` | Optional lookup for credit/loyalty | Synced down; POS can create locally |
| `sales` | Every completed sale (append-only) | Local source of truth for reports |
| `outbox` | Unsynced mutations | `pending ??? syncing ??? synced | failed` |
| `cashiers` | Staff + PIN + role | `cashier | supervisor` |

**Key types**

```ts
StoreProfile { id, storeName, storeType: 'Owned'|'Franchise'|'Subscriber',
               hubId?, currency, receiptFooter, plan?, planExpiry?, deviceId, deviceLabel }

PosProduct   { id, sku, name, category, price, cost?, unit, stock?, trackStock, isActive }

PosSale      { id (client-generated), deviceId, storeId, cashierId, shiftId,
               lines: PosSaleLine[], subtotal, discount, tax, total,
               payments: PosPayment[], change, customerId?, customerName?,
               status: 'completed'|'refunded'|'voided', createdAt, syncState }

PosPayment   { method: 'Cash'|'Transfer'|'Card'|'Credit', amount, reference? }
OutboxItem   { id, type: 'sale'|'refund'|'shift'|'customer', payload, attempts, lastError?, createdAt }
```

### Why sync is simple here
Sales are **append-only facts** ??? two tills can never "edit the same row," so there are **no merge conflicts**. The only shared mutable quantity is **stock**, which is treated as *eventually consistent*: the till shows a local estimate; the server is truth and reconciles on sync. A till may oversell during a long outage ??? that is a business decision (allow, warn, or block), configurable per store.

---

## 4. Sync protocol

1. Sale completes ??? written to `sales` **and** enqueued in `outbox` (one transaction).
2. Flush triggers: `online` event ?? interval (~30s) ?? manual "Sync now" ?? app foreground.
3. FIFO drain; each item POSTs with its **client-generated id** as the idempotency key.
4. Success ??? mark `synced`. Failure ??? increment `attempts`, exponential backoff, keep queued. Never blocks the UI.
5. Pull-down (catalog/prices/customers) on connect, versioned by `updatedAt`.

**Trust through visibility:** a persistent status pill shows Online/Offline + pending count; every sale row shows its own sync state. Cashiers must be able to *see* that nothing was lost.

---

## 5. Multi-tenant model

| Store type | Catalog | Sales sync | Isolation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Owned** | Pulled from FudFarmer inventory (hub-scoped) | Push into CRM Sales + stock movements | Full internal access |
| **Franchise** | Pulled, franchise-scoped pricing | Push, tagged to franchise for royalty/performance reporting | Sees only own store |
| **Subscriber** | **Own catalog**, self-managed | Stays in their own tenant ??? never touches FudFarmer data | Hard-isolated; plan + expiry gate |

Everything funnels through `SyncBackend`, so tenancy is a config concern, not a code-fork.

## 6. Phases

**Phase 1 ??? Sell offline** ??? *shipped & verified*
Store setup + cashier PIN login ?? product grid + search ?? cart (qty, line discount) ?? payments (cash w/ change, transfer, card, split, credit) ?? receipt ?? IndexedDB + outbox + sync engine ?? service worker + manifest ?? sync status UI.

**Phase 2 ??? Operate the till** ??? *shipped & verified*
Shifts (open/close, opening float, cash count, variance) ?? X/Z reports ?? refunds & voids behind supervisor PIN (stock restored, original stamped for audit, reversal mirrored as a negative record) ?? held/parked carts.

**Phase 2.5 ??? Supervisor** ??? *shipped & verified*
PIN-gated supervisor screen, reachable with or without an open till.
- **Cashier performance** (per day): net/gross, transactions, items, avg basket, cash taken, sales per hour, payment mix, discounts given, refunds ??? ranked, with **risk flags** (refund rate, discount rate, drawer variance, unreconciled shift).
- **Transaction journal**: every transaction for the day ??? expandable to line items, payments, change, customer, receipt no., sync state; filter by cashier / sales vs refunds; search by receipt, customer or product. Reversals show who authorised them and why.
- **Closing stock**: per-product opening ??? sold ??? returned ??? expected closing (opening derived backwards from live stock), closing value at cost, plus a **physical stock count** with per-product variance and total shrinkage in units and naira.
- **End-of-day reconciliation**: trading summary + payment mix, cash walk (floats ??? cash sales ??? cash refunds ??? expected vs counted), **closing-stock position**, per-shift variance, and guards that block closing the day while shifts are open or records unsynced. Day variance counts **only reconciled shifts**.

**Phase 2.6 ??? Supervisor assist** ??? *shipped & verified*
An in-store help channel so a stuck cashier never has to leave the till.
- **Cashier** taps the life-ring: picks an issue type (price override, discount, wrong item, payment problem, complaint, stock, cash drop, sync stuck), adds detail, flags "customer waiting", and can **attach the live cart**. The till never blocks. A badge tracks their open and resolved requests.
- **Supervisor** gets an Assist queue (urgent first, wait time shown, cart visible), can claim ("I'll handle it"), dismiss, or **Fix & resolve**.
- Resolution performs a **real action**, not just advice: **price override** and **stock correction** write to the catalog, **cash drop** records money moved to the safe, **retry sync** flushes the outbox, or resolve with guidance. Every action is logged with before ??? after values and the supervisor's name.
- **Cash drops reduce expected drawer cash** in the shift/day reconciliation, so money taken to the safe never reads as a shortage.

**Phase 2.7 ??? PRD gap closure: tax, discounts, partial returns** ??? *shipped & verified*
Closing the highest-priority gaps found auditing against the POS PRD.
- **Tax (??3, ??5, ??25)**: store-level rate, label and inclusive/exclusive mode. Inclusive breaks VAT out on screen and receipt without changing what anyone pays; exclusive adds it at checkout. Recomputes after discounts.
- **Discounts (??13)**: per-line and cart-level, entered as **% or fixed amount** with quick-pick chips. A store `maxDiscountPct` hard-caps them, and anything above `discountApprovalThresholdPct` **blocks checkout until a supervisor authorises it**.
- **Partial returns (??11, ??12)**: pick the quantity per line, choose a **reason** (7 preset reasons + free-text note). Refund value, tax and stock all restore **pro-rata**. Repeat returns are capped at what remains, the original stays `completed` until everything is back, and it carries a cumulative `returnedQty` audit trail.
- **Settings migration**: existing installs are backfilled with the new tax/discount policy rather than silently running with it undefined.

**Phase 2.8 ??? RBAC, permission matrix & settings** ??? *shipped & verified*
- **Five roles (??21)**: Cashier, Store Manager, Inventory Manager, Finance, Super Admin ??? replacing the old `cashier | supervisor` boolean. Legacy tills migrate `supervisor ??? manager` automatically, and gain any role they predate.
- **Permission matrix (??22)**: 16 permissions ?? 5 roles as data in `lib/permissions.ts`, with the PRD's **tri-state** ??? full / **limited** / none. "Limited" is meaningful: a cashier may discount *up to* the threshold, start (but not approve) a refund, and see *only their own* reconciliation.
- **Enforcement**: every hardcoded `role === 'supervisor'` check is gone. Approvals now test the *permission*, so Finance and Admin can authorise too ??? not just managers. Verified: a cashier sees Refund but **no Void and no Settings**; an admin sees all three.
- **POS Settings (??25)**: store & receipt, tax, discount rules, return policy, offline/device, staff, and a read-only render of the live permission matrix. Gated by `settings.manage`, saves back to the store profile and applies immediately.

**Phase 3 ??? Tenancy**
Store-type onboarding ?? subscriber catalog manager (CRUD + import) ?? plan gating & expiry ?? device registry ?? cashier management.

**Phase 4 ??? Integrate with CRM**
Synced sales land in CRM Sales + stock movements (channel = POS) ?? franchise & subscriber performance as an Insights dataset ?? consolidated multi-store analytics.

## 7. Conventions

- **Never `await` the network to finish a sale.** Local write first, enqueue, return.
- **All ids are client-generated** (`deviceId` + timestamp + random) so retries are idempotent and tills never collide.
- **Money is integer kobo internally**, formatted at the edges ??? no float drift.
- **Touch-first UI**: large tap targets, keypad entry, high contrast, works one-handed on a tablet.
- **Every write goes through `lib/db.ts`**; components never touch IndexedDB directly.
- Swapping to a real backend = implementing `SyncBackend`. Nothing in the UI changes.
